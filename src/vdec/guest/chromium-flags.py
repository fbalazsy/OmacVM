"""Chromium's switches for its V4L2 decoder. Run AS THE USER (install.sh does):
chromium-flags.py on|off|check

  --enable-features=AcceleratedVideoDecoder   Chromium's V4L2 decoder, off by
      default in builds without VA-API (Arch Linux ARM's)
  --load-extension=/usr/local/lib/omacvm/chromium-no-av1   YouTube sends
      VP9 instead of AV1, which this Chromium decodes only on the CPU

The extension lives beside this script, not in /usr/local/share/omacvm: apply
replaces that whole tree, and an apply of only some features (a repair, a
feature switch) does not install Chromium video again. Up to 3.1.4 it was
there and such an apply left Chromium a missing extension ("Failed to load
extension"); "on" moves the old path in the user's file to the new one.

Chromium keeps only the LAST of each switch on its command line, and Arch's
launcher reads /etc/chromium-flags.conf, then ~/.config/chromium-flags.conf
(Omarchy's, which has both). So each value goes into the last such switch of
the user's file (several flags may share a line), or into a new line with
/etc's last list plus the value when the user's file has none. A marker in
~/.local/state/omacvm remembers what was added, so "off" never removes what
the user set. Files are replaced whole (a temporary file, then a rename), so
Chromium never reads half a file; a linked file stays a link (its target is
replaced). check: exit 0 when Chromium would get both and the extension is
there."""
